## R Consortium Funded Carpentries Instructor Training

```
Laurent Gatto
Software/Data Carpentry Instructor
Senior Research Associate, University of Cambridge, UK
```

## The [**Software**](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [**Data Carpentry**](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)

> Their **mission** is to *teach researchers in science, engineering,
> medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to
> get more done in less time and with less pain.*

The quality and success of the Software and Data Carpentry bootcamps
is assured by high-quality, pedagogically sound, collaboratively
developed and openly-available teaching material and **instructors**,
who themselves are trained in effective teaching methodology.

## The workshop


- Proposal: http://github.com/lgatto/SC-ICS-Proposal
- Accepted: February 2016
- Training: 19-20 September 2017, Cambridge, UK
- 29 participants

## Outputs (1)

Status on 6 January 2017

- 10 completed (most for both DC and SC)
- about half a dozen are in progress
- remaining dozen haven't done anything since the training ended
- [Blog post](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-10-18-cambridge-instructor-training-19-20-september)

> pretty good so far

Our one-year completion rate is somewhere 40% - 60%, depending on the
group.  When we start poking people at the end of Jauary ("finish or
time out"), we'll see an up-tick.
