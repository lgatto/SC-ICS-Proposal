# Software Carpentry ICS proposal

The R consortium invites the community to submit
[ISC Proposals](https://www.r-consortium.org/about/isc/proposals):

> The goal of the Infrastructure Steering Committee (the ISC) is to
> support projects that broadly help the R community. This might be
> software development, developing new teaching materials, documenting
> best practices, standardising APIs or doing research. Currently, the
> ISC chiefly provides financial support for projects proposed by
> individuals or teams who have the skills to carry out the work, but
> we can also provide administrative support, promotion and some
> collaboration tools for groups who would like to study more
> ambitious projects.

[Suggestion](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/r-discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2015-December/000354.html):
